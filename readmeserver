run this command in the mern auth (root folder) folder : npm init -y then install express
then make a server folder and create a folder inside it named index.js,
then go to package.json and under 'description' and above 'main' write : "type": "module"

then install mongoose,
go to mongodb website and signin to mongodb atlas, after setting up , create a new project in mongodb atlas. then go to database under the deployment tab and build a database (free).
give the network access to everyone on the mongodb atlas website. then go the 'database' then 'connect' then "drivers" and copy the url.
then change the url that is give the password and give the name of the db before '?' if you dont give any name mongodb will itselt make a db name test


to create and add user model
- we create model to interct with db
create models folder in the server

to create api route (api route is kind of url, we can use these url to interact with api)
- we can make api in the index.js but we make them in another folder in server namely routes.
after we make the file inside the routes, we import the file inside the index.js file to access it

we create controllers folders and inside this we are going to write the api route logic, then we export it and import it in router.js file and use the controller:
this : 
<!-- router.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.json({
    message: "Api is working",
    });
}); -->
becomes: <!-- router.get("/", test); -->
where test is defined in controller folder insider userCtrl.js file : 
<!-- export const test = (req, res) => {
    res.json({
        message: 'Api is working',
    });
}; -->

how to encrypt password in the db:
install bcrypt, then import it in authctrl.js where we are creating a new user and saving it in the db.
save the password in hash password, then send the db the hashpasssword(code is commented in cuthctrl.js)


********************************************************
lets make the signin page and connect it to api(backend):

1) make backend

- go to server -> routes -> authRoute.js : make a route for signin,

- then make the signin function in the folder server -> controllers -> authctrl.js

- now check the api route in postman
